All reads (both short- and long-read) have been submitted to NCBI under the project ID PRJNA1254181 (but are not yet publicably available).

The genomes were mainly assembled using [hybracter](https://github.com/gbouras13/hybracter) which assembles long-reads and polishes with short-reads (i.e. a long-read first hybrid assembly) to produce accurate and complete genomes. Some were also assembled using [flye](https://github.com/mikolmogorov/Flye) (long-read only) and [unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) (short-read first hybrid assembly)

For more information about how the genomes were assemblied see the methods section of the associated preprint on BioRxiv:
